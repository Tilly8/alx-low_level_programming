In this project we learnt about Automatic Allocation and Bynamic Allocation. Also we got to learn about malloc which is a function that is called enabling us to request for a specific amount of memory space from the competers memory system to store our data temporarily. Further we learnt about the fucntion called free which is used to ensure that the memory we borrowed when we used the function malloc is returned to the computers memory pool to be reused for other purposes.
